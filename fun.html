    <h2>1. Shopping List</h2>
    <p>This project came into existence because I wanted to save time with a household chore, namely doing the weekly food shop.</p>

    <h4>Previous Approach</h4>
    <p>The previous approach was for my wife to keep a notebook on the kitchen side where we would write down anything we had run out of and needed from the supermarket. </p>
    
    <p>Then the evening before, we would do our meal plan for the week ahead and the wife would then add what was needed for these meals onto the list.</p>
    
    <h4>Pain Point</h4>
    <p>The issue was that it was inefficient as a new list was started from a blank sheet of paper each week which would use up time. And often the basics (milk, bread etc.) would be missed out. Another issue was that the list wouldn't follow the order of layout of the food leading to either the list being re-written to match or the shopper having to re-trace their steps throughout the store.</p>
    
    <h4>Solution</h4>
    <p>I built a very simple website in html / css to solve these problems. It is a checklist with the items grouped depending on where they are in the store. Each grouping has a free type field at the bottom so we can add anything that is not regularly required but may be needed ad hoc that specific week.</p>

    <p>Each week, a blank checklist is printed out and left on the side. Then if, during the course of the week, we run out of cereal or teabags, this item is ticked in the list.</p>
    
    <p>At the end of the week, we do the meal plan and my wife ticks off the items needed for the week <b>but</b> has the benefit of seeing all items we usually buy so there will be a visual reminder about staples such as milk or bread for example.</p>

    <p>The result of this change is a frictionless system which saves us time every single week and ensures we never forget the milk!</p>

    <h2>2. Mileage Tracker</h2>
    <p>This was borne out of my own curiosity and wanting to know how many miles I did per year.</p>
    <h2>3. Python scripts</h2>
    <h2>4. Personal website</h2>
