    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
      <h3>Taps not Pipes</h3>
        <p>
        If delivering data insight was compared with plumbing, then I focus on the taps not the pipes.</p>
        <p>Not just <b><i>any</i></b> taps, but the kind that feel good to use: waterfall flow, smooth handles, well-placed and user-tested. Because the tap is where the user meets the system. You can build the most intricate plumbing behind the wall, but if the tap squeaks, leaks, is too hard to turn or confuses the user then the whole experience fails.</p>

        <p>
        In data work, this means I specialize in that last mile: where data becomes understanding. Where numbers get turned into meaningful visuals. Where the difference between a 3 second delay and a fast, tactile response might mean someone actually uses the report they were given. That’s my lane. And I love it there.
        </p>

        <!-- <blockquote>

      <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>I'm a Business Insights Developer specialising in Power BI, with a particular focus on user experience, visual clarity and DAX craftsmanship. I enjoy building reports that are not only functional but thoughtful tools that the user actually enjoys interacting with.</p>
      <h3>Where</h3>
        <p>I work in a cross-functional product team often in a fast-moving environment. I bring structure and calm to the chaos, using data to bring clarity, not confusion.</p>
      <h3>What I care about</h3>
        <p>At heart, I care about maintainable, human-first data products. I'm not in this to build flashy, shiny reports or to build technical debt. Indeed these are two of my pet hates! I'm here to make people's lives easier by delivering work that's clear, logical, and quietly powerful.</p>

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h2>My Approach</h2>
    
    <h3>Empathy for the End User</h3>
    <p>Everything I build is for the people using it. That means clear layouts, intuitive navigation, relevant filtering and knowing when to say no. Good UX isn't just a design choice, it's a form of respect.</p>

    <h3>Maintainability</h3>
    <p>Anyone can ship something that works for today and for today's scenario. It's harder (but totally worth it) to build something that makes sense months or even years later. I aim for clean DAX code, well-named measures, logical models and good documentation. You can never have too many comments or too much documentation.</p>
    
    <h3>Craftsmanship</h3>
    <p>I take pride in how things are done. From small touches like tooltips to larger patterns like dynamic titles or reusable components. I treat report-building as a craft, not a conveyor belt.</p>
    
    <h3>Agility & Pragmatism</h3>
    <p>I understand real-world pressures. While I care about quality, I also believe wholeheartedly in shipping early and iteratively. I don't chase perfection. I balance what's good with what's good enough, for now.</p>

    <h3>Quiet Excellence</h3>
    <p>I'm not the loudest voice in the room and I don't believe good work needs a fanfare. I'll let my work speak for itself. But I'll advocate for thoughtful design and user-centred choices wherever I can.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <h3>Excel</h3>
    <p>Like many Power BI pros, I started in Excel. That's where I first learned to think in terms of models (through Power Pivot), to care about formatting and styling and to help people understand numbers, not just calculate them. </p>

    <h3>Evolved Thinking</h3>
    <p>I used to believe in the mantra: "get the model right and the DAX writes itself." But as requirements became messier and more bespoke I learned that while this works for perfect demo data, real-life data needs a little extra help. No real data model can do everything. Strong DAX skills, thoughtful UX and creative problem-solving then become a way of life for really advanced messy scenarios.</p>

    <h2>Current Interests</h2>
    
    <h3>Vega-Lite</h3>
    <p>I've been exploring Vega-Lite coding within a Deneb custom visual in Power BI. It's a really good way of taking a report to the next level when the default visualisations aren't quite good enough and a really promising space for data storytelling or data communication.</p>
    
    <h3>Craft & Communication vs Tools</h3>
    <p>I'm increasingly interested in the idea that our value as BI professionals comes not from the tools we use but from how we use them. Good communication, sound and robust logic, clear and simple design and empathy for the users will always matter more than what the tool can do or what its latest new feature is.</p>

    <h3>NO(T ONLY) CALCULATE DAX</h3>
    <p>The more I write DAX, the more I realise it can be much more than just for calculating things. It can be a pseudo-scripting language used to express logic and solve complex puzzles. This section name is a nod to <code>CALCULATE</code> - an undoubtedly powerful function but also a reminder that DAX is not just CALCULATE. 
      
    <p>Whenever I see someone else tackle a DAX measure it's as if their thought process is: "It's DAX so it must be CALCULATE" without truly thinking through the problem and assessing if this is the correct approach.</p>

    <p>This is a technical note for fellow developers but the take-away is universal: use the right tool for the job, not just the most powerful one.</p>

    <!-- <blockquote>

    <h2>Away from Work</h2>
    
    <h3>Family & Children</h3>
    <p>I have a wife and three children who keep me busy and engaged. We are close-knit family and I see my parental role as being a provider and a facilitator for my children. We try to prioritise communication as a family. For example, we make a point of sitting down together during the week and having proper conversations around the table when we can. These are not necessarily parent-led conversations. It's a small ritual but one that helps us stay connected in this busy, social media filled life!</p>
    <h3>Football Coaching</h3>
    <p>I'm the assistant coach for a youth football team which scratches a different itch: camaraderie, encouragement, strategy, desire to share tactical and technical knowledge and a bucket load of patience! Actually, much like team-based dev work really!</p>

    <h3>Travel & Foreign Languages</h3>
    <p>I love languages and exploring different cultures. Nothing makes me happier than finding a truly local place to eat or finding a plaza to sit in and watch the locals go about their day. It reminds me that communication isn't about just words, it's about clarity, context and empathy.</p>
    <p>I have a passion for languages for the same reason that I enjoy Power BI development. I love logic and pattern recognition and learning to communicate in a different voice. At different times of my life, I have studied to different levels of attainment (!) French, German, Dutch and Spanish. </p>

    <h3>Cryptic Crosswords</h3>
    <p>This again is about logic, pattern recognition and lateral thinking. Solving a cryptic clue and writing a DAX measure both scratch that same itch for me and in both cases I take pleasure in a clean, robust solution.</p>
