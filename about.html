    <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p><b>I'm a systems thinker disguised as a BI developer.</b></p>
        <p>For most of my career I've tried to squeeze myself into job titles: SQL Developer, DBA, Power BI Developer, Data Migration Specialist. None of them ever felt like they fit.</p>

        <p>Because the truth is: <b>I don't think in tools. I think in systems.</b></p>

        <p>I've always gravitated toward the end-to-end flow: how information moves, where friction builds, where clarity breaks and where you can intervene to make the whole system simpler, faster, cleaner and more human.</p>

        <p>And I'll learn whatever skill is needed to improve the system. But I've never wanted to <i>become</i> that skill.</p>

     <hr class="section-divider">

    <h2>My Origin Story</h2>
        <p>The first clue came over 20 years ago when I was working for a shoe broker. We had a main Microsoft Access database and I was asked to produce commission reports for the finance team. This was a slow, manual, week-long process.</p>

        <p>Instead I built a second Access database (to ringfence both datasets), taught myself SQL querying, automated the workflow and collapsed five days of effort into one.</p>

        <p>I basically removed most of my own job. And yes, I soon left because I got bored.</p>

        <p>Years later I heard my replacement, when he learned that I had built the system, comment: <b>"He was clever!"</b></p>

        <p>It makes me laugh but it also clarified something important: </p>
        <p><b>I've always been the person who makes systems smoother, clearer and easier. Not the person who grinds through them.</b></p>

        <p>Everything since has been an extension of that instinct.</p>

     <hr class="section-divider">

    <h2>Taps, Not Pipes</h2>

      <p>If delivering insight is like plumbing, I focus on the <b>taps</b>, not the pipes.</p>

      <p>Not just any tap either. The kind that feels great to use. Waterfall flow, smooth handles, easy to turn, well-placed and user-tested. <b>Because the tap is where the user meets the system.</b></p>

      <p>In data, that means:</p>
      <ul class="tight-list">
        <li>clarity</li>
        <li>usability</li>
        <li>speed</li>
        <li>empathy</li>
        <li>design</li>
        <li>communication</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>I care less about shiny pipelines and more about the moment a user actually understands something and makes a better decision because of it.</p>

      <p>The last mile, where information becomes insight, is my craft.</p>

     <hr class="section-divider">

    <h2>What I Do Today</h2>
      
      <p><b>I build human-first data products.</b></p>
      <p>Clear, logical, maintainable. Quietly powerful.</p>

      <p><b>I specialise in:</b></h3>
      <ul class="tight-list">
        <li>Power BI (with a strong focus on UX, design, DAX craft and performance)</li>
        <li>Elegant, robust data models</li>
        <li>Storytelling and communication</li>
        <li>Vega-Lite / Deneb for advanced visuals</li>
        <li>Systems-level thinking across end-to-end reporting workflows</li>
        <li>Reducing complexity, friction and cognitive load</li>
        <li>Delivering clarity in messy, real-world requirements</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>I typically work inside cross-functional product teams bringing structure, calm and logic to fast-moving environments. My role is often the same:
      <b>make the system make sense.</b></p>

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h2>How I Work</h2>
    
    <h3>Empathy for the End User</h3>
    <p>Everything I build is for the people using it. That means clear layouts, intuitive navigation, relevant filtering and knowing when to say no. Good UX isn't just a design choice, it's a form of respect.</p>

    <h3>Maintainability</h3>
    <p>Anyone can ship something that works for today and for today's scenario. It's harder to build something that makes sense months or even years later. I aim for clean DAX code, well-named measures, logical models and good documentation. You can never have too many comments or too much documentation.</p>
    
    <h3>Craftsmanship</h3>
    <p>I take pride in how things are done. From small touches like tooltips to larger patterns like dynamic titles or reusable components. I treat report-building as a craft, not a conveyor belt.</p>
    
    <h3>Agility & Pragmatism</h3>
    <p>I understand real-world pressures. While I care about quality, I also believe wholeheartedly in shipping early and iteratively. I don't chase perfection. I balance what's good with what's good enough, for now.</p>

    <h3>Quiet Excellence</h3>
    <p>I'm not the loudest voice in the room and I don't believe good work needs a fanfare. I'll let my work speak for itself. But I'll advocate for thoughtful design and user-centred choices wherever I can.</p>


    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h2>Current Interests</h2>
    
    <h3>Vega-Lite</h3>
    <p>I've been exploring Vega-Lite coding within a Deneb custom visual in Power BI. It's a really good way of taking a report to the next level when the default visualisations aren't quite good enough and a really promising space for data storytelling or data communication.</p>
    
    <h3>Craft & Communication vs Tools</h3>
    <p>I'm increasingly interested in the idea that our value as data professionals comes not from the tools we use but from how we use them. Good communication, sound and robust logic, clear and simple design and empathy for the users will always matter more than what the tool can do or what its latest new feature is.</p>

    <h3>NO(T ONLY) CALCULATE DAX</h3>
    <p>The more I write DAX, the more I realise it can be much more than just for calculating things. It can be a pseudo-scripting language used to express logic and solve complex puzzles. This section name is a nod to <code>CALCULATE</code> - an undoubtedly powerful function but also a reminder that DAX is not just CALCULATE. 
      
    <p>Whenever I see someone else tackle a DAX measure it's as if their thought process is: "It's DAX so it must be CALCULATE" without truly thinking through the problem and assessing if this is the correct approach.</p>

    <p>This is a technical note for fellow developers but the take-away is universal: use the right tool for the job, not just the most powerful one.</p>


    <hr class="section-divider">
    
    <h2>Who I Am Outside Work</h2>
    
    <h3>Cryptic Crosswords</h3>
    <p>This is about logic, pattern recognition and lateral thinking. Solving a cryptic clue and writing a DAX measure both scratch that same itch for me and in both cases I take pleasure in a clean, robust solution.</p>
    
    <h3>Football Coaching</h3>
    <p>I'm the assistant coach for a youth football team which scratches a different itch: camaraderie, encouragement, strategy, desire to share tactical and technical knowledge and a bucket load of patience! Actually, much like team-based dev work really!</p>

    <h3>Travel & Foreign Languages</h3>
    <p>I love languages and exploring different cultures. Nothing makes me happier than finding a truly local place to eat or finding a plaza to sit in and watch the locals go about their day. It reminds me that communication isn't about just words, it's about clarity, context and empathy.</p>
    <p>I have a passion for languages for the same reason that I enjoy data. I love logic and pattern recognition and learning to communicate in a different voice. At different times of my life, I have studied French, German, Dutch and Spanish to varying levels over the years. </p>

    <h3>Family & Children</h3>
    <p>I have a wife and three children who keep me busy and engaged. We make time to sit down together during the week and have proper conversations around the table when we can. These are not necessarily parent-led conversations. It's a small ritual but one that helps us stay connected in this busy, social media filled life!</p>
