    <h1>An Iterative Approach to DAX Problems</h1>
    <p>Perhaps a different approach to solving thorny DAX issues.</p>
  
    <p>When I see colleagues attempting to write DAX functions (or Excel formulae or SQL queries) their approach seems to be to try and think of all cases at once and write the formula while thinking of all cases. Almost as if they only get one chance and it must be right first time.</p>
    
    <p>I find it incredibly overwhelming to try and consider every possible case at once and for this reason I have refined my approach.</p><p>I tend to be iterative, starting small before expanding to cover all cases:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Isolate one row of the source and write the formula to work in this case.</li>
      <li>Expand this logic to include all rows.</li>
      <li>Test and refine for edge cases, nulls and blanks.</li>
    </ul>
      
    <p>This approach serves me well because it limits the issues I come up against and allows me to solve them one at a time rather than having to think of trying to solve many issues all at once. </p>
    
    <p>In addition as a visual learner, I find the feedback of seeing the result at each step a big help in understanding what is going on and why. This practical knowledge helps me refine the measure quickly and in a robust fashion so it produces the correct result in all cases.</p>

    <p>Sometimes the solution starts small and snowballs.</p>
