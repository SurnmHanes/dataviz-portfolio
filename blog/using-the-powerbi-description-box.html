    <h1>Using the Power BI Description Box</h1>
    
    <p>You're building a report against a deadline and you reach for a measure but there are two with nearly identical names, which one do you need? You can't remember and need a refresher to remind yourself exactly what each one is for and which one you need now in the current context.</p>

    <p>There is a field in Power BI desktop which I use which is free-type and allows the developer to describe what each measure actually does. This field can be found in the Modelling view: </p>

      <figure><img src='../images/PowerBIDescBox.png' alt='Power BI Description Box' style='max-width:100%; height:auto;'><figcaption>Location of Power BI Description Box</figcaption></figure>
      <figure><img src='../images/DecriptionBox.png' alt='Power BI Description Box' style='max-width:100%; height:auto;'><figcaption>Power BI Description Box</figcaption></figure>
    
    <p>Since this is free-type, it enables the developer to be quite verbose and so offers a better alternative to relying solely on the name of the measure to describe it.</p>

    <p>A further benefit is that this can serve as lightweight documentation. By using the DAX INFO functions, these descriptions can be extracted from the model and used as a basis for model documentation outside of Power BI:</p>
      <figure><img src='../images/info.measures.png' alt='Info.Measures function' style='max-width:100%; height:auto;'><figcaption>The output of INFO.MEASURES() includes the Description.</figcaption></figure>

    
    <p>One final benefit is that this description appears on a hover over. So when you're in the canvas creating a new visual and you want a measure but can't are not sure which one you need, if you go to the Data panel on the right hand side and hover the mouse the description will appear:</p>

      <figure><img src='../images/PowerBIDescription-HoverOver.png' alt='Power BI Measure hover over' style='max-width:100%; height:auto;'><figcaption>The measure tooltip includes the description.</figcaption></figure>

    <p>This enables you to select the correct measure quickly and without having to change context and thus improves the developing experience.</p>

    <p>I've talked about this in relation to measures but every object (tables, calculated tables, columns, calculated columns) has a description box so this approach can be applied across all objects in the model.</p>

    <p>So next time you create a measure, spend an extra 20 seconds adding a description in this box. Your future self and fellow developers will thank you.</p>
