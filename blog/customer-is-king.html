    <h2>Ignore Feedback at Your Peril</h2>
    <p>I remember once being involved in the creation of a report. The main visual was a bar chart showing a bar per month over a 12 month period similar to the below:</p>
    
    <figure><img src='../images/CustomerIsKingMonthlyMileage.png' alt='bar chart showing monthly mileage over 12 months' style='max-width:100%; height:auto;'><figcaption>A bar chart showing monthly mileage over a 12 month period</figcaption></a>

    <p>There was a team discussion going on and the product owner was telling us about a call he had been on with the customer. One of the feedback items the customer raised was regarding their wish for an average line to be added to the bar chart visual in Power BI. </p>
    
    <p>This comment got a little bit of push back from the developers. Their reasoning was "there is a card to the right of the chart displaying the average over the period, can't they just use that?"</p>

    <p>My thinking was:</p>
    
    <h4>(a) Customer Feedback Is Gold</h4>
      
    <p>Customer feedback is super valuable and should always be taken seriously to drive the direction of travel. If it's not difficult to implement we should absolutely do what they ask for 
      
    <h4>(b) They're Asking For A Visual Enhancement</h4>
    
    <p> They're asking for a visual enhancement for a reason: it makes comparison month by month easier and cognitive load lower as they can visibly see how this average compares with each of the month bars.</p>

    <h4>(c) Customer Is King</h4>

    <p>They are the subject matter experts and understand the interaction and relationship between the data points. If we're not building to the end users's specifications (who is ultimately paying us) then what are we doing other than massaging our own egos.</p>

    <h2>The Value of Customer Feedback</h2>

    <p>True customer feedback is rare and valuable. The end user lives in the report. They use it every day or every week and it helps inform their decision making. A well-crafted report should make it obvious what they need to "do" next.</p>

    <p>Because the report becomes a key part of their decision-making process, they will identify and notice the pain points, the friction of the existing report before you, as the developer, will.</p>

    <p>Quite simply, they will log more hours using the report than you will. They will identify clunky navigation, illogical processes, slowly-rendering visuals or visuals with high cognitive load.</p>

    <p>When they bring an idea it's from a perspective of having struggled and we should never ignore their struggle. Ignoring them risks eroding trust and is likely to damage the relationship with them.</p>

    <p>In addition, they tend to surface the most glaring or the highest ROI issues which means that a simple (from the dev's point of view) fix will go a long way in building trust in the relationship, trust in the report and ultimately the rate of adoption of the product.</p>

    <h2>The Cognition Factor</h2>

    <p>While it seems like adding such a line is a redundant request, we have to put ourselves in the shoes of the report user. Suppose we want to compare how a particular month has done against the average over the period. This currently involves:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Looking up the month in question and finding the value by reading the figure off the y axis.</li>
      <li>Then looking up the average as per the card. </li>
      <li>Then mentally comparing the two figures to work out which one is higher.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If the average line was on the chart, this 3 step process would be shrunk to one step: look at month in question and see where the average line crosses the column.</p>
