The underlying data combines annual US Box Office receipts from 1977 onwards, sourced from Box Office Mojo.</p><figure><img src='/images/USDomesticBoxOffice_Original.png' alt='Original Visualisation' style='max-width:100%; height=auto;'><figcaption>Original Visualisation â€“ Source: TrendlineHQ (data from BoxOfficeMojo.com)</figcaption></figure><br><p>This was an interesting visual to me and showed simply the stark effect of COVID-19 on cinema-goers in the US. I also thought it was a nice simple remake to start with.</p><p>I felt the little caption / narrative emphasising the change from 2019 would be the tricky part and I wanted to investigate whether this was possible in Deneb.</p><h2>Methodology</h2><h3>Design Notes</h3><p>A measure was created in Power BI to sum up the total Box Office Gross value.</p><p>A bar mark was then used within Vega-Lite to create the column chart. This was encoded with the measure for the y-axis and the year for the x-axis.</p><p>A parameter was used in the config to hold the hex colour for the columns. This choice was made to aid flexibility: If I want to switch colours in future, this only needs changing in the configuration, I don't need to go through the specification. This was then referenced in the mark.</p><p>By default the x-axis labels were displayed at 45 degrees to the horizontal. I changed this angle to 0 degrees to aid readability as I'm not a fan of having to tilt my head to read these!</p><h3>Challenges</h3><p>Since the dataset began in 1977, a transform filter was used to ensure the x-axis began with the year 2000 to mimic the original.</p><p>A title was added as well as a subtitle. The value of these were strings.</p><p>The formatting of the y-axis needed to reflect the fact that it was a currency and, in addition, was quoted in billions. This was achieved using a label expression in the axisY property in the config. This expression said if the label value is zero, return that value, otherwise append '$' to the formatted value.</p><p>The last thing was the arrows which are made using point marks and certain styles I defined in the config. We created two styles (_arrowdown and _arrowleft) and then in the specification, layered two point marks with the bar mark. The point marks would then reference each of the styles created.</p><h2>Compromises</h2><p>There were a couple of things outside the scope of Deneb. It is only possible to have one title and one subtitle per visual so I was unable to create the three lines of titling as per the original. Or rather I was unable to format three lines in three different ways. Hence the headline is actually a Power BI card.</p><p>The narrative on the right hand side was also not possible in Deneb. It is not possible to format a substring in a different way to the rest of the string. This is also not possible in native Power BI. To achieve this with the red and green text colouring I used another custom visual called HTML Content which allows you to write in HTML with inline CSS styling and positioned this above the Deneb visual.</p><h2>Outcome</h2><figure><img src='/images/USDomesticBoxOffice_Remake.png' alt='Vega-Lite Remake' style='max-width:100%; height:auto;'><figcaption>My Deneb Remake</figcaption></figure><h2>Code</h2><p>You can view the full Vega-Lite config and specification below:</p><a href='https://gist.github.com/SurnmHanes/805f2c93c6c60c7e3351db609e4f55e6'>US Domestic Box Office Collection - Vega-Lite Config</a><br><br><a href='https://gist.github.com/SurnmHanes/2deea32f5e7c794b0981df689826ba4f'>US Domestic Box Office Collection - Vega-Lite Specification</a>"

Ever since I found out about Deneb in around 2021, I have been fascinated and enthralled by the power it can wield within Power BI. I have also, if I'm honest, been frustrated in almost equal measure along the learning journey!</p><p>I've always wanted to improve my ability with the Vega-Lite grammar which the Deneb visual uses. This mini-project felt like a really good way to get hands-on and develop and hone my skills and understanding.</p><p>The idea is quite simple: scour the internet for interesting visuals and see if I can re-create them inside Power BI using the Deneb custom visual.</p>"

    "content": "<h2>Summary</h2><p>A heatmap seen on Threads displaying the ratings for every episode of every series was recreated using Vega-Lite inside a Deneb custom visual in Power BI.</p><h2>Inspiration & Background</h2><p>I found this chart (<a href='https://www.threads.com/@infobeautiful/post/DHMu4q4sJhq/the-sudden-collapse-of-westeros-the-sudden-death-of-a-tv-show'>Game Of Thrones</a>) on the Information is Beautiful Twitter / X page showing the ratings for each episode of every season of Game Of Thrones in heat map form. Although I'm not a Game Of Thrones fan, the visual intrigued me and having little experience of building heat maps, I thought this would make an interesting task to re-create using Vega-Lite inside a Deneb custom visual in Power BI.</p><figure><img src='/images/GameOfThrones_Original.png' alt='Original Visualisation'><figcaption>Original visualisation by <a href='https://informationisbeautiful.net/' target='_blank'>Information is Beautiful</a>, shared via <a href='https://www.threads.com/@infobeautiful/post/DHMu4q4sJhq/the-sudden-collapse-of-westeros-the-sudden-death-of-a-tv-show' target='_blank'>Threads</a>.</figcaption></figure><br><p>The visual is a two-dimensional chart (episodes on y-axis, series' on x-axis) displaying a rating out of 10 for each series/episode combination. Additionally the ratings are 'bucketed' and colour-coded based on their rating category. The image also has a cover image and title on the left hand side but this doesn't form part of this remake.</p><h2>Methodology</h2><p>My first step was creating the raw data manually since I couldn't access the original source of the data. As part of the import process I then used Power Query to unpivot the data to provide 3 columns of data: Series, Episode and Rating which I could then use in the visual.</p><p>The remake required layering two charts to give the appearance of one, a very common technique in Vega-Lite inside Deneb: one to create the heat map rectangles and then another to overlay the rating labels in each rectangle.</p><h3>Design Notes</h3><p>The first thing to do was to create the heat map shapes. This was done using a rect mark. We then used a text mark to display the text for the ratings in each rectangle, the two marks being layered together in the code and sharing the x and y co-ordinate encodings.</p><p>We then used conditional formatting to colour the rectangles according to the buckets and also to colour the text black or white according to the rating.</p><h3>Challenges</h3><h4>Y Axis</h4><p>One of the first challenges I encountered was two-fold and involved the y axis. Firstly how do I prefix the axis labels to show the 'E'? And secondly, once I'd achieved that, how could I sort them into the correct order given they are no longer purely numeric labels?</p><p>The solution is fairly straightforward in Vega-Lite, once you know how! We create a transform.calculate expression to solve the first part. A transform.calculate is similar to a calculated column in Power BI: this idea of deriving a new column in the dataset using a calculation based on an existing column or columns.</p><p>So in this case, we create a new 'calculated column' called YAxisLabel which is the character 'E' prefixed on the episode number.</p><p>This YAxisLabel calculated column is then used in the y-axis encoding which brings us to our second problem. By default this will then have the incorrect sort order because, for example, Vega-Lite thinks that 'E10' and 'E11' come before 'E2'.</p><p>To resolve this issue, we can use the sort property of the y encoding. This allows us to sort by the Episode field (which is purely numeric) in an ascending order. Pretty neat!</p><h4>Colour Legend</h4><p>The next challenge came in colouring the rectangle shapes based on the episode rating. The first step here was to understand the thresholds for the various categories. For instance identifying that an episode was considered 'Awesome' if it had a rating over 9 or a 'Bad' episode garnered a rating of between 5 and 6, for example.</p><p>Once the thresholds were understood, another transform.calculate was used to create a new 'calculated column' called 'Rating Category'. In Power BI language, the Rating Category was essentially a SWITCH statement (or a series of IF statements) which returns the category depending on the rating score.</p><p>This Rating Category column was then used in the color encoding of the rect mark.</p><h4>Font Colour</h4><p>Now that we have coloured all the rectangles according to the episode rating, this meant that some of the text displaying the rating on the rectangle became hard to read. Dark colour on a dark background or conversely a light colour on a light background. To resolve this, we would need to introduce some conditional logic that says: if the rectangle colour is dark, then use white for the text, otherwise use black.</p><p>We introduced this logic in the color encoding of the text mark by using a condition / test expression where we said if the rating was less than 6 or above 9, then use white text otherwise use black text.<h2>Compromises</h2><p>There were no real compromises that needed to be made to achieve a decent reproduction of the original visual. I was very pleased with how straightforward the task turned out to be and with how close to the original the end result was.</p><h2>Outcome</h2><figure><img src='/images/GameOfThrones_Remake.png' alt='Vega-Lite Remake' style='max-width:100%; height:auto;'><figcaption>My Deneb Remake</figcaption></figure><h2>Code</h2><p>You can view the full Vega-Lite config and specification below:</p><a href='https://gist.github.com/SurnmHanes/0d02326420713f8235f7253ce9de6553'>Game Of Thrones Episode Ratings - Vega-Lite Config</a><br><br><a href='https://gist.github.com/SurnmHanes/ea57f8ff4dc43cfe7c7b18922fb17e9f'>Game Of Thrones Episode Ratings - Vega-Lite Specification</a>"
