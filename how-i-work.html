    <h2>Approach & Mindset</h2>
    <p>
      I solve problems like puzzles. Not always linearly, and rarely by following a script. My thinking is flexible, creative, and pattern-driven. Give me the Lego bricks and context, and I’ll build solutions that go beyond the instruction manual.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy finding unexpected paths, noticing what's not obvious, and building elegant solutions that are clean, robust, performant, and future-ready. While others look for step-by-step guides, I often look for principles and patterns.
    </p>

    <h2>Remote-First, Async-Strong</h2>
    <p>
      I work best with space. Space to think, test, write, and iterate. That’s why I favour asynchronous communication over constant check-ins. I’ll always respond thoughtfully and promptly, but I don’t need a daily call to stay aligned.
    </p>
    <!-- <div class="highlight"> -->
      <blockquote>
      <strong>I’m looking for my next role to be 100% remote.</strong> Because it’s how I deliver my best work. Remote isn’t distance; it’s discipline, focus, and trust.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Agile, But Make It Real</h2>
    <p>
      I believe Agile is a mindset not a tick box exercise. If we’re going to do it, then let’s do it properly: clear goals, real collaboration, and the discipline to say no when needed. I don’t do Performative Agile: all ceremonies and no follow-through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too often, teams “flex” the process into something that looks Agile, but really isn't. People work on unsized work or sneak in scope with “I might as well do that while I’m here” logic. That’s how scope creeps, timelines slip and tech debt builds.
    </p>

    <h2>Working With Me</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Give me a clear goal and context:</strong> I’ll ask questions if needs be, then get moving.</li>
      <li><strong>Async > meetings:</strong> I value deep work time. I’ll always respond, but I work best with autonomy.</li>
      <li><strong>Scope control matters:</strong> “One quick tweak” or "a quick and dirty addition" is never just that. Let’s be intentional about change.</li>
      <li><strong>I challenge with care:</strong> I’ll raise a flag if we’re veering off course and I welcome being challenged, too.</li>
      <li><strong>Users first, not dev-first:</strong> A clever solution means nothing if it isn’t usable or scalable. Let's build for users, not for egos.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h2>What I Avoid</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Shiny slides, vague logic:</strong> I’d rather have a rough hand-sketched diagram that makes sense than a glossy deck that doesn't. Or a glossy deck that breaks if any requirements change (which they will).</li>
      <li><strong>Hierarchy-driven design:</strong> Good ideas should win, not job titles.</li>
      <li><strong>Fake agility:</strong> If we don’t size it, track it, or close the loop and therefore learn for next time, we’re not Agile.</li>
    </ul>
